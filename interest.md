## Hobbies

### Cycling 

During my down time, I enjoy cycling to relax both phyiscally and mentally. I been trying to get faster to be fast enough to start racing locally. 
Twice a year I try to do the [Triple Crown](https://triplecrownforheart.ca/route), which is cycling up three local mountains in one ride.
Aside from just cycling, I like socializing with people, admire the scenery and like to try various cafes during the trips.

### Badminton

I have played badminton ever since I was in elementary school. I still play today and enjoy socializing with friends and meeting new people.
