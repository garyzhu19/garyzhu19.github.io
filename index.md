## About Me

Ever since competing in highschool robotics, I became passionate about technology and innovation. The competition made me realize how much I love technology and how interesting of a career it is.

I recently graudated with a Bachelor of Applied Science (Electrical Engineering) with Co-op experience from the University of British Columbia (UBC).

My resume can be found on the sidebar and previous internships and work experiences can be found in [experiences](./work-experience).

Projects I have completed during school are found in [projects](./project.html).

Aside from all the technical information, I'm a fairly competative person with interests in [cycling, badminton](./interest.html).
