## Projects

### Street Parking Detection Using Deep Learning

*	Labeled images manually using CVAT to ensure custom annotated data is consistent.
*	Trained a [deep learning model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NHfDsYC87bIM2R7VOGkOlPpxji_UCLbV/view?usp=sharing) (YOLOv4) noting loss, mean average precision (MaP) and testing scores to see improvements over revisions.
*	Analyzed the training and testing data to improve the model performance and to prevent overfitting.
*	Communicated progresses of the project to clients professionally and taken feedback in tunning the model.

### FreeRTOS Task Scheduling

*	Implemented SRP and EDF with CBS Server task schedulers in C with [FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/) as the base code.
*	Collaborated with other teammates on GitLab for implementation strategies and code reviews to ensure efficient and correct implementations.
*	Documented the entire code base with Doxygen to verify the code is well documented.
*	Coded with MISRA C:2012 coding standard to validate code is safely implemented.

### MNIST Database Classifiers

*	Researched various machine learning classifiers for image classification prior to implementation.
*	Analyzed 5 different classifiers results to see which classifiers work better for which digits of the [MNIST dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database).
*	Used the best classifiers for specific digits and combined the classifiers to create the overall classifier output.
